# University-Data-Insights-Dashboard

I've developed an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help university leadership analyze and interpret key faculty-related data.  
This dashboard delivers actionable insights to support strategic planning, academic development, and policy decision-making.

🔍 **Key Insights Provided:**
- Distribution of faculty members across colleges by country of origin (sponsorship/delegation)
- Gender distribution of faculty (male vs. female)
- Scientific productivity by faculty (publications and research output)
- Identification of the most academically advanced colleges
- Faculty performance indicators and institutional contribution metrics

📊 **Developed using**: Power BI  
📁 **Data Source**: Simulated dataset representing a university’s faculty profile  
🎯 **Purpose**: Support data-driven decisions in academic management and human resources
